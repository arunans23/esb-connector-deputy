Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB Deputy connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
       https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

Tested Platform: 

 - Mac OSx 10.9, Mac OSx 10.10.3
 - WSO2 ESB 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download ESB 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT from official website. Extract the ESB and put "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" under $JVM_MEM_OPTS into {ESB_HOME}/bin/wso2server.sh.

 2.	Please make sure that the below mentioned Axis configurations are enabled ({ESB_Connector_Home}/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml).
		
		<messageFormatter contentType="text/html" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
		<messageBuilder contentType="text/html" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

 3. Follow the below mentioned steps to add valid certificate to access Deputy API over https.

     i)   Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to created Deputy account.
     ii)  Place the downloaded certificate into "<DEPUTY_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products" folder.
     iii) Navigate to "<DEPUTY_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute the following command.

                 keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME"

          This command will import Deputy certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
          To import the certificate give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

          NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME - Replace CERT_FILE_NAME with the file name that was extracted from Deputy with the extension. (e.g. deputy .crt)
                 CERT_NAME - Replace CERT_NAME with an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. Deputy).
 4. Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-4.9.0.zip and copy that zip file in to location ""<ESB_HOME>/repository/".

	ix)	    intOpunitId			        	-   Use a valid Operational unit ID (Operational Unit 3 is valid and created by default).
	x)	    blnPublish			    		-   Use a value 1 or 0 as the boolean value representing the roster is published.
